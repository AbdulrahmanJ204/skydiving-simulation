# 🧠 Skydiver Simulation Project
The Skydiver Simulation Project is a comprehensive 3D simulation of a skydiver's flight, including physics, scene management, camera control, input handling, and UI updates. The project utilizes the Three.js library for 3D rendering and physics simulations, providing a realistic and immersive experience. The simulation is managed by the `SimulationManager` class, which orchestrates the interactions between various components, including the `CameraManager`, `SceneManager`, `InputManager`, and `Physics` classes.

## 🚀 Features
* 3D simulation of a skydiver's flight
* Realistic physics simulations, including gravity, drag, lift, and Coriolis forces
* Camera control and movement
* Input handling for user interaction
* UI updates for simulation statistics and final values
* Customizable simulation settings and parameters

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Frontend: Three.js, Vite
* Build Tools: Vite, vite-plugin-restart
* Dependencies: gsap, lil-gui, vercel
